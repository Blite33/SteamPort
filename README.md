## What all the variables mean
In the script, you'll see that there is a bunch of variables like "build, unsuccessfull_builds, unsuccessfull_builds_beta, unsuccessfull, beta, demo, fork_build, and fork".
Most of them are obvious and easy to understand, but you may not understand why there is one called fork, because there is only one fork of SteamPort.
The reason for this is internal, mainly just for fun.
The reason for beta is if i am testing a feature that is not functioning at all.
The reason for Demo, is if I want to fix a problem, but i need help from a forum. This is internal use.
## I dunno what else to put here...
